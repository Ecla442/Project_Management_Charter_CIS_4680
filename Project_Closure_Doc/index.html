<label><b>STAR Story 1, Team #2: IT Procurement and Governance</b></label>
<textarea placeholder=" S: Situation: In the previous workplace that I was in, there were certain policies that needed to be met before I received my credentials. 
  T: Task: To fill out forms needed, and answers required in order for credentials to be obtained.  
  A: Action: In the meantime, I took action by asking when they would be approved for processing and completion. All the while I went ahead and did tasks around the office, such as imaging computers, taking asset management, and clearing out any hardware that needed to be completed. Also, I followed up with the proper channels in order to know when the timeline would be completed.
  R: Result: The task of credentials was eventually completed. With that, I managed to put in a lot of work, as having a security credential is no joke, and to let my employer know that I am willing to get the job done, being a contractor here. "></textarea>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<label><b>STAR Story 2: Team #1: Good Steward</b></label>
<textarea placeholder="S: Situation: In the workplace that I formerly was at, I ran into an uncomfortable encounter with a co-worker of mine.  
  T: Task: The task in hand was to let it go, or to report, and to make sure that written documentation was written down in order to receive proper investigation. 
  A: Action: While this investigation was going on, I handled my workload at work the best way that I could by focusing on other things. I reported the matter and went about my business afterwards. 
  R: Result: The investigation was solved, and actions were put forth against the offender as such. They were reprimanded correctly. I still managed to remain respectful and thoughtful throughout this time."></textarea>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<label><b>STAR Story 3: PMI Principle #9: Navigate Complexity</b></label>
<textarea placeholder="S: Sitaution: For my CIS 4580, Computer Networks course, we considered the project of a Raspberry Pi, with VPN implementation attached. 
  T: Task: The task at hand was to record and to demonstrate a video presentation to show the process of how I would make a secure makeshift router using a Pi 5. We have attached the meeting minutes and delegated projects via a group vote. 
  A: Action: The project was a bit frustrating as the Pi had a lot of failures and conflicts within my home network. However, the main solution was to look on YouTube and, with my knowledge, create a makeshift topology and purchase the necessary networking materials. I also had to remind myself to slow down and take it easy, as I put myself in many loops. 
  R: Result: The project was finished as I managed to get connectivity via pinging a specific IP address and setting up a VPN afterward. "></textarea>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<label><b>STAR Story 4: PMI Principle #11: Embrace Adaptabilty and Resilency</b></label>
<textarea placeholder="S: Situation: In embracing adaptability, I formerly worked at an IT Help Desk position at another school that I attended. I was there for a year, and was speaking to my manager regarding shifting around to another department to shadow. 
  T: Task: I networked with my main manager/supervisor as an IT Intern, and they mentioned that they would put in a good word for me to shadow in a new department. 
  A: Action: While this was taking place, I handled my tickets and incidents being a Tier 1 Help Desk representative. Otherwise, I continued to discuss this opportunity with my manager. 
  R: Result: Unfortunately, I did not stay up there long enough to see this opportunity. However, I later received other internship opportunities that would help me move forward with increased mobility and more experience on my resume. "></textarea>

<div class="panel">
<label><b>STAR Story 5: PMI Principle #6: Demonstrate Leadership Behaviors</b></label>
<textarea placeholder="S: Situation: At a former workplace that I was at, another new hire and I were interning. He was a 2nd year, at CSUDH, and this was his first IT job. 
  T: Task: My task was to teach him the ropes, as I already had some experience in the Desktop Support Field. If he had any questions, I could help, but at the moment, my team lead would be able to assist him. 
  A: Action: There was one ticket in particular in which a customer asked for a special items in the ticket notes. He looked at it, which it was a keyboard and mouse, and thought it was another thing. I corrected him by saying that was not needed, but another item was. He understood within that moment. 
  R: Result: When we went back up to the lab, the person who submitted the ticket made sure to send an email in regards to their items being shipped correctly. "></textarea>

          <input type="text" value="Daniel Tang, Network Engineer III" />
          <label>Date of Meeting</label>
          <textarea>November 17th, 2025.</textarea>
          <label>Selection Rationale</label>
          <textarea>I chose this candidate as I know this person from a previous workplace. I noticed that when I worked with them, they were also a Network Engineer in progress, so I thought it was best to pick their brain in how their workplace day goes along with project management. </textarea>
          <label>Conversation Summary</label>
          <textarea>I asked Daniel about how his company manages with Project Management, and he gave me a great outlook about what working in government would look like. He provided me with insight into what to work towards to become a Network Engineer, as well as some aspects of his own career. He is a hard worker, and I appreciated this interview.</textarea>
          <label>Key Insights</label>
          <textarea> - Daniel spoke about how to get into this industry and what certifications to pursue in this field. Additionally, he introduced me to the day-to-day aspects of his field, providing insight into how a project typically progresses. He showed me some insight into what government contracting may look like if I choose to pursue that path as a Network Engineer. Government is a highly popular field in terms of IT, as well as various corporate fields in general. He also displayed soft skills, most importantly, as that is a pinnacle step in terms of communication with others and with stakeholders as well.  </textarea>

          <input type="text" value="Vanessa Dotson, Technical Sales Support" />
          <label>Date of Meeting</label>
          <textarea>November 30th, 2025</textarea>
          <label>Selection Rationale</label>
          <textarea>I deduced that I did not need to interview 3 Network Engineers, and that I had to balance these interviews out. It was best to look for someone who does not work in the IT field, and this candidate was a suitable choice for an interview after reviewing profiles on LinkedIn.</textarea>
          <label>Conversation Summary</label>
          <textarea>Vanessa went into detail about what a Technical Sales Specialist does for a daily workday as well. She delves into what Technical Sales entails for her, as well as how she collaborates with others. She spoke on certifications that she has, as well as some outside things it takes to be a part of the project management sector.</textarea>
          <label>Key Insights</label>
          <textarea>Some key insights were the many hours that you need to gain these certifications and courses. She relayed some tips on what project management looks like, as it may appear differently to each person in terms of how they interact. She explains how her workflow works for her position and what some of the daily requirements are to complete assignments for stakeholders. She also relayed what is needed in terms of soft skills to be hired in this field. I've noticed that soft skills are crucial to being an effective project manager or to be able to work under one.   </textarea>

          <label>Date of Meeting</label>
          <textarea>December 04, 2025</textarea>
          <label>Selection Rationale</label>
          <textarea>A well-established project manager who has a lot of certifications and experience. It was very decorated when I saw his profile, and I thought that this was a good candidate to reach out to and interview. </textarea>
          <label>Conversation Summary</label>
          <textarea>He spoke along side how he deals with his project manager career. He gets into the intricaces of what it takes to be a project manager and how to interact with others being a project manager. He faces some pressure, however, none too much greater for him. I got a first-hand insight look of what it takes to handle this position.  </textarea>
          <label>Key Insights</label>
          <textarea>Some of the insights received were the tasks that he takes on such as projects being approved, budget allocation, approval and status updates from stakeholders. He also speaks upon some of the domestic, as well as international projects that he has taken on, which are impressive. He does say that he faces pressure, as it is a lot to handle, as stated before with the different type of tasks that you face with limited time management that you have. He speaks on some projects that he has worked with, as well what the future looks like, and whether this field is going to pan out for him in 5-10 years.   </textarea>
